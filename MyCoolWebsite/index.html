        A <strong>blockchain</strong> is a distributed ledger with growing lists of records (blocks) that are securely linked together via cryptographic hashes.<sup>[1][2][3][4]</sup> Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree, where data nodes are represented by leaves). The timestamp proves that the transaction data existed when the block was created. Since each block contains information about the previous block, they effectively form a chain (compare linked list data structure), with each additional block linking to the ones before it. Consequently, blockchain transactions are irreversible in that, once they are recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks.</p>

<p>Cryptographer David Chaum first proposed a blockchain-like protocol in his 1982 dissertation "Computer Systems Established, Maintained, and Trusted by Mutually Suspicious Groups."<sup>[10]</sup> Further work on a cryptographically secured chain of blocks was described in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta.<sup>[4][11]</sup> They wanted to implement a system wherein document timestamps could not be tampered with. In 1992, Haber, Stornetta, and Dave Bayer incorporated Merkle trees into the design, which improved its efficiency by allowing several document certificates to be collected into one block. <sup>[4][12]</sup> Under their company Surety, their document certificate hashes have been published in <em>The New York Times</em> every week since 1995. <sup>[13]</sup></p>
<h2>Structure and design</h2>
<hr>

<p>A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed, and often public, digital ledger consisting of records called blocks that are used to record transactions across many computers so that any involved block cannot be altered retroactively, without the alteration of all subsequent blocks. <sup>[3][20]</sup> This allows the participants to verify and audit transactions independently and relatively inexpensively. <sup>[21]</sup> A blockchain database is managed autonomously using a peer-to-peer network and a distributed timestamping server. They are authenticated by mass collaboration powered by collective self-interests. <sup>[22]</sup> Such a design facilitates robust workflow where participants' uncertainty regarding data security is marginal. The use of a blockchain removes the characteristic of infinite reproducibility from a digital asset. It confirms that each unit of value was transferred only once, solving the long-standing problem of double-spending. A blockchain has been described as a <i>value-exchange protocol</i>. <sup>[23]</sup> A blockchain can maintain title rights because, when properly set up to detail the exchange agreement, it provides a record that compels offer and acceptance. <sup><i>[citation needed]</i></sup>
<br><br>

    Logically, a blockchain can be seen as consisting of several layers: <sup>[24]</sup>
    
    <ul>
        <li>infrastructure (hardware)</li>
        <li> networking (node discovery, information propagation <sup>[25]</sup> and verification) </li>
<li>consensus (proof of work, proof of stake) </li>
<li>data (blocks, transactions) </li>
<li>application (smart contracts/decentralized applications, if applicable) </li>
    </ul>

    </p>
<h2><b>Blocks</b></h2>
<p>Blocks hold batches of valid transactions that are hashed and encoded into a Merkle tree.<sup>[3]</sup> Each block includes the cryptographic hash of the prior block in the blockchain, linking the two. The linked blocks form a chain.<sup>[3]</sup> This iterative process confirms the integrity of the previous block, all the way back to the initial block, which is known as the <i>genesis block</i> (Block 0). <sup>[26][27]</sup> To assure the integrity of a block and the data contained in it, the block is usually digitally signed.<sup>[28]</sup></p>
<h2>Supply chain</h2>
<p>There have been several different efforts to employ blockchains in supply chain management.
    <ul>
        <li> <b>Precious commodities mining</b> — Blockchain technology has been used for tracking the origins of gemstones and other precious commodities. In 2016, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> reported that the blockchain technology company Everledger was partnering with IBM's blockchain-based tracking service to trace the origin of diamonds to ensure that they were ethically mined. <sup>[112]</sup> As of 2019, the Diamond Trading Company (DTC) has been involved in building a diamond trading supply chain product called Tracr.<sup>[113]</sup>
            </li>
        <li><b>Food supply</b> — As of 2018, Walmart and IBM were running a trial to use a blockchain-backed system for supply chain monitoring for lettuce and spinach — all nodes of the blockchain were administered by Walmart and were located on the IBM cloud. <sup>[114]</sup></li>
        <li><b>Fashion industry</b>There is an opaque relationship between brands, distributors, and customers in the fashion industry, which will prevent the sustainable and stable development of the fashion industry. Blockchain makes up for this shortcoming and makes information transparent, solving the difficulty of sustainable development of the industry. <sup>[115]</sup></li>
    </ul>
